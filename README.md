### 👋 Hello Tech Enthusiasts!

I’m Konstantin Milonas, an EU citizen with both German and Greek roots, currently honing my skills in **Data Analytics** through a Masterschool bootcamp while diving deeper into the field of **Data Engineering**.

With extensive experience as a Senior Retail Consultant, I bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise that I am excited to apply to my future roles in the tech industry.

👀 I’m passionate about Data Engineering, Data Analytics, and exploring how technology can make life simpler.  

🌱 Currently, I’m focusing on SQL as part of my Masterschool Bootcamp. Alongside this, I’m independently exploring Git, GitHub, Docker, AWS, and Python, all of which I find fascinating. I plan to decide on my primary focus by early 2025.

💻 I value clear and direct communication, teamwork, and exchanging ideas in a positive and supportive environment.  

💞️ Let’s collaborate on projects involving data analysis, Python automation, or even creative uses of Docker and AWS!  

🍳 When I’m not working on data, I love cooking for friends and family, exploring nature through hiking, Nordic walking, or biking with my e-bike. I also enjoy listening to audiobooks and dancing salsa with my wife!  

⚡ Fun fact: I’m half Greek, but I don’t look like it – so I often surprise people when they find out!  

Let’s connect and grow together!
